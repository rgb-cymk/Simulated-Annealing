# Simulated-Annealing

Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It's used to find approximate solutions for optimization problems, particularly those with many local optima, by mimicking how a solid is slowly cooled to reach a low-energy state. 

Here, I implement SA to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classic optimization problem that asks for the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. It's a core concept in computer science and operations research, relevant for various real-world applications like logistics, circuit board design, and more. Our toy problem is to find the shortest distance between a number of US State capital cities. We benchmark our implementation against other challenges, Eli etc, and impose additional conditions to test its robustness.
